Better MakerLab "in context" quote:

"The Douglas College Maker Lab is conceptualized as a space to meet like-minded individuals who want to experience, and experiment with, the latest in technological equipment. At the same time, it is a flexible meeting space that serves as a teaching space for Douglas College students, and an opportunity for community groups to meet or intermingle. Led by members of the Douglas College Digital Cultures Lab, the Maker Lab encourages thinking about the mythologies of technology. The MakerLab encourages innovation and fosters the application of emerging technological trends, particularly as they apply to entrepreneurship and skills development."

The Douglas College MakerLab:

- values experimentation and the free exchange of knowledge
- acts as a meeting space for a diverse group of like-minded individuals
- encourages mentorship by providing a space where institutions, community groups, and businesses can collaborate, rapidly developing and testing new ideas
- fosters innovation by providing a unique human and technological infrastructure
- engages the community through its visibility and location within the River Market
